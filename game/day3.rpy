    mc "(It's significantly darker outside now. I can still see a hint of purple in the sky, but the sun is almost completely set. The streetlights begin to turn on, lighting up the sidewalk.)"
    mc "(It's not a long walk home, but I have to carry my food with me. The bags I have them in are slowly pressing into my hands.)"
    mc "(At last, I am home again. My hands are tired of carrying the bags, so I drop them off on the counter. I sit down in the chair and relax for a bit before I start to make dinner.)"
    mc "(I'll just heat up some of the frozen food. It should be simple enough, right? I just need to follow the instructions on the box and it should be alright.)"
    mc "(I heat up the food and eat it while watching TV.)"
    mc "(After that, I take a shower and put on my pajamas, getting ready for bed. I still have a while before I should probably sleep, so I wash and dry my casual clothes.)"
    mc "(Finally, it's time to sleep again. I've gotten used to my new place, so sleeping is a lot easier now.)"
    mc "(I don't even need to toss and turn anymore.)"

    mc "(Yet another day of life. I can't say I'm excited to go to work, but at least it gives me something to do.)"
    mc "(I get out of bed and get ready for the day. I probably shouldn't eat ramen for breakfast, but I'm an adult and I can make decisions for myself. I slurp it down and head for work.)"
    mc "(I arrive at the office building, ready to fill out more paperwork. I wave hello to Sigma, head to the department, and start working.)"
    mc "(It's not even lunch break yet but I'm already bored of working. My focus begins to waver from the identical looking papers and soon enough I'm fully distracted.)" 
    mc "(I can't make any mistakes in the documentation, but I also can't be bothered to do something this boring for hours upon hours. It's probably time for me to take a break.)"
    mc "(I get up from my desk and head over to the break corner. Joe Joe still isn't there, but it might be because I came at a different time."
    menu:
        "I'll get a cup of..."
        "Water":
            mc "(I grab one of the paper cups attached to the water cooler and fill it up slowly. The conical shape makes it easier to stack and fold the cups, but it holds significantly less water.)" 
            mc "(I admire the bubbles rising from the water cooler into the water jug and take a sip of water.)"
            mc "(The water is quite refreshing, but I don’t feel like it’s helping very much. Maybe the coffee would’ve been a better choice.)"
            mc "(I slowly sip the cup while looking around the office. I feel more focused now.)"
        "Coffee":
            mc "(I grab a cup and place it underneath the nozzle. With a press of a button the coffee begins pouring out, filling up the cup with a light whirring noise.)"
            mc "(The coffee smells amazing and I can feel the heat of it through the paper cup. It warms up my fingers, making me feel more energized before I even take a sip.)"
            mc "(The coffee itself is quite nice. It doesn’t taste particularly good, but it does the job.)"
            mc "(I finish the cup, trying to get the last remaining drops of coffee before tossing it away. I feel more energetic now.)"
    mc "(I try to head back to my cubicle when someone bumps into me, knocking me over.)"
